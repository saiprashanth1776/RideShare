## RideShare
RideShare is a fault-tolerant, highly available cloud based application which 
offers the facility of allowing users to pool rides. This project implements the backend
of the RideShare application. Some of the features of this application include,
<li> Creating a new user
<li> deleting an existing user
<li> Create a new ride
<li> Joining existing rides
<li> Finding all rides for a particular destination
<br> and more..

The project was built in stages, with each Assignment building up on the previous. The final project can be found
in the Project-DBaaS folder.

#### Branches
RideShare can be tested on your local machine, but it is intended to be deployed across multiple instances in the cloud.
Depending on the usage, there are two branches present,
<li> <b>master</b> : Suitable for running RideShare on 1 instance. </li>
<li> <b>cloud-ready</b> : Slight changes making it easier to deploy to the cloud across 3 VM instances. </li>
